    "Assume you are new to the data science field, and you want to find out what real practitioners and soon-to-be data scientists are concerned about. One place where you may find such information is X (formerly known as Twitter). However, X users often use their real identities and may have reservations about sharing all their opinions publicly. Another place where such information maybe found is the datascience subreddit on Reddit.com (https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/). Users are assumed to be anonymous and they are more likely to share their opinions without reservations. To find out common concerns among the datascience subreddit users, it might be a good idea to collect the top 100 posts in the subreddit in the year 2024. You might also collect the top 3 comments of each of those posts. In this case study, we will do exactly that. Specific details can be found in the next few cells. \n",

    "Once you have the mechanism in place to retrieve data from Reddit, you next step is to determine which parts of the data is necessary. For this case study, collect only the top posts from the year 2024. Also consider if the score of each post was above 50 or not. If the score was below 50, it might not have been an important post. Do not consider those posts. \n",

    "* posts are only from the year 2024: 10 points\n",

    "* only posts with scores more than 50 were considered: 10 points\n",
